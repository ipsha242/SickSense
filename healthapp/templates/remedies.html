            <br>Allergies occur when your immune system reacts to a foreign substance — such as pollen, bees or pet dander — or a food that doesn't cause a reaction in most people. Your immune system produces substances known as antibodies. When you have allergies, your immune system makes antibodies that identify a particular allergen as harmful, even though it isn't. When you come into contact with the allergen, your immune system's reaction can inflame your skin, sinuses, ur, or digestive system.

        <li><a href="#"><b>About the disease:</b>
          <br>Cholestasis is the slowing or stalling of bile flow from your liver. Your liver produces bile and delivers it to your digestive system through a network of vessels called bile ducts. Bile ducts run through your liver (intrahepatic ducts) as well as outside of it (extrahepatic ducts). They connect your liver, gallbladder, mai and small intestine. These organs and bile ducts make up your biliary system. When bile can’t flow properly through your biliary system, it affects all of these organs and vessels. Bile backs up in your bile ducts and organs, irritating the tissues and interfering with their function. Bile also begins to leak into your bloodstream, which has a toxic effect. It causes uncomfortable symptoms, and eventually, illness. Cholestasis can be a temporary problem or an ongoing and worsening one.

By damaging your immune system, HIV interferes with your body's ability to fight infection and disease. HIV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It can also be spread by contact with infected blood and from illicit injection drug use or sharing needles. It can also be spread from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth-f or breastfeeding. Without medication, it may take years before HIV weakens your immune system to the point that you have AIDS. There's no cure for HIV/AIDS, but medications can control the infection and prevent itprogression of the disease.

      <ul class="dropdown-content dropdown-content-1">
        <li><a href="#"><b>About the Disease:</b>
          <br>Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy.
            
            Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to g the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy.
            
            With diabetes, your body doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use it as well as it should. When there isn’t enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.
            
            There isn’t a cure yet for diabetes, but losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active can ,help. Other things you can do to help:
            
            Take medicine as prescribed.
            Get diabetes self-management education and support.
            Make and keep health care appointments.

        <li><a href="#"><b>About the Disease:</b>
          <br>A highly contagious skin infection that causes red sores on the face. Impetigo mainly affects infants and children. The main symptom is red sores that form around the nose and mouth. The sores rupture, ooze for a few days, then form a yellow-brown crust.
            Antibiotics shorten the infection and can help prevent the spread to others.
            
            <br><br><b>Home Remedies:</b>
            <br>Soak the infected area in warm water for 15 to 20 minutes.
            <br>Scrub the area gently with a washcloth and antibacterial soap.
            <br>Apply antibiotic ointments.
            <br>Cover the area with gauze or a loose plastic bandage, if possible.
            
            <br><br><b>Prevention:</b>
            <br>Appropriate personal hygiene and frequent body and hair washing with soap and clean, running water is important to help prevent impetigo. You should wash the clothes, linens, and towels of anyone who has impetigo every day. These items should not be shared with anyone else.</a></li>
